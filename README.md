# pet_aggregation
My final project application could be accessed by this URL (https://ssuying.pythonanywhere.com/pets/).
There is no need to install any library to run this url. 
In addition, users can easily access the data stored in the sqlite database by typing keywords in the search box
shown on the top-left side of the website. However, there are some limits to the keywords. Users could only type 
breed name from all 38 breed names I had, age options from baby, young, adult and senior, and the color name from 
all 49 color names I had. For example, I had a color name “Brown / Black”, typing brown, Brown, Black, black or 
“Brown / Black(space matters)” will retrieve back this color name.
